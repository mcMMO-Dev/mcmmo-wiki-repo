# Mining

Mining consists of mining stone and ores. It provides bonuses to the amount of materials dropped while mining.

## XP Gain

To gain XP in this skill, you must mine with a pickaxe in hand. Only certain blocks award XP.

Compatible Materials: Stone, Coal Ore, Iron Ore, Gold Ore, Diamond Ore, Redstone Ore, Lapis Ore, Obsidian, Mossy Cobblestone, Ender Stone, Glowstone, and Netherrack.

## How to use Super Breaker

With a pickaxe in your hand, right click to ready your tool. Once in this state, you have about 4 seconds to make contact with Mining compatible materials, which will activate Super Breaker.

## What is Super Breaker?

Super Breaker is an ability with a cooldown tied to the Mining skill. It triples your chance of extra items dropping and enables instant break on Mining materials.

## How to use Blast Mining

With a pickaxe in hand, crouch and right-click on TNT from a distance. This will cause the TNT to instantly explode.

## How does Blast Mining work?

Blast Mining is an ability with a cooldown tied to the Mining skill. It gives bonuses when mining with TNT and allows you to remote detonate TNT. There are three parts to Blast Mining. The first part is Bigger Bombs, which increases blast radius. The second is Demolitions Expert, which decreases damage from TNT explosions. The third part simply increases the amount of ores dropped from TNT and decreases the debris dropped.
