# Fishing
> This page is under construction, **you** can add to it and help complete it!
{.is-warning}

The **fishing** skill allows you to fish faster and catch more unique treasures while fishing.

## XP Gain

Catch fish.

## Treasure Hunter

Level Requirement: 10 (100 for retro)

This ability allows you to find treasure from fishing with a small chance of the items being enchanted. Every possible treasure for Fishing has a chance to drop on any level. It depends however what the rarity of the item is how often it will drop. The higher your Fishing skill is, the better your chances are to find better treasures. It is paired with **Magic Hunter** to also give enchanted items.

> Fishing drops are completely customizable, so results vary server to server.
{.is-warning}

Each treasure is organized into one of six categories, increasing in tier:

* Common
* Uncommon
* Rare
* Epic
* Legendary
* Mythic

Your level dictates your percentage chance of getting any of the specified types of items. The higher your level, the higher your chance of rarer items.

## Ice Fishing

This passive skill allows you to fish in ice lakes! Cast your fishing rod in an ice lake and the ability will create a small hole in the ice to fish in.

## Master Angler

Level Requirement: 15 (150 for retro)

This passive skill increases the bite chance while fishing. When you've unlocked this ability, fishing while in a boat improves odds of catching a fish.

## Shake

Level Requirement: 15 (150)

This active ability allows you to shake items loose from mobs by hooking them with the fishing rod. Mobs will drop items they would normally drop on death. It is also possible to acquire mob skulls, which are normally much more difficult to obtain in survival mode.

Shake items off of mobs or players with your fishing pole.

On mobs this will damage them for 1/4 of their total health. Starting in mcmmo 2.2 this has an upper limit of 10 damage. This means that a mob with over 40 health (20 hearts) will at most have 5 hearts removed every shake. This is only useful for servers with custom boss mobs and does not change anything for normal gameplay.
